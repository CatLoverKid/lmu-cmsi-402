### 1.1 / 1.2) What are the basic tasks that all software engineering projects must handle? AND Give a one sentence description of each of the tasks you listed:
The Basic Tasks that all software engineering projects must handle are:
- Gathering Requirements from the Client/Customer
- Creating a High-Level Design Requirements for the product
- Breaking that High-Level Design into Lower-Level Design Requirements
- Developing the agreed-upon design that you and the Client created. This is where the product takes its initial form, and where the majority of the work is done
- Testing the Product that has been developed, taking advantage of QA engineering strategies to ensure that the product that is delivered to the client is as bug-free and functionally capable as possible.
- Deploying the, now improved, software in a way that was agreed-upon previously with the client

### 1.3) What does JBGE stand for and what does it mean?
JBGE stands for Just Barely Good Enough, it refers to the practice of creating very minimal (if any) documentation to support software at ANY stage of production. It’s a very poor practice in terms of maintaining a product’s lifespan and ease-of-maintenance, and can result in headache farther down the road. The only exception for where JBGE is allowed, is in some code comments. In this situation, brevity is the soul of wit, and conservation of space.

### 3.2) Use critical path methods to find the total expected time from the project's start for each task's completion. Find the critical path. What are the tasks on the critical path? What is the total expected duration of the project in working days?
There are two critical paths for this project: Q-M-E-D-G and Q-M-E-D-I-H, the total expected time for this path is 33 days, and as a result, the total expected time to complete this project is 33 days.

### 3.3) On seperate document

### 3.6) In addition to losing time from vacation and sick leave, projects can suffer from problems that just strike out of nowhere. Sort of a bad version of deus ex machina. For example, senior management could decide to switch your target platform from Windows desktop PSs to the latest smartwatch technology. Or a strike in the Far East could delay the shipment of your new servers. Or one of your developers might move to Iceland. How can you handle these sorts of completely unpredictable problems?
You can expect the unexpected by extending deadlines for projects that are delayed, or you can create new tasks to suck up time that represent the time lost.
3.8) What are the two biggest mistakes you can make while tracking tasks?
The Biggest mistake a PM can make while tracking tasks is to ignore problems that arise, and hope that they will go away later down the road. The second-largest mistake that can be made is mindlessly adding more developers onto a project, and expecting the project to be done faster.

### 4.1) List five characteristics of good requirements:
- Clear
- Unambiguous
- Consistent
- Prioritized
- Verifiable


### 4.3) Split tasks into categories:
a: Functional
b: Functional
c: Functional
d: Functional
e: Functional
f: Nonfunctional
g: Nonfunctional
h: Nonfunctional
i: Functional
j: User
h: Functional
i: Functional
j: Functional
k: Functional
l: Functional
m: Functional


### 4.9)
Changes:
Must:
- Nothing, App is functional as-is.
Should:
- None
Could:
- Could include rephrased text on “New Game” Button to “Give Up”, which will display the correct answer
- Could allow Users to input custom words into their local database of existing words
- Could include a win/loss ratio, which is displayed in the corner
- Could include a category system for words
- Could include common Phrases
- Could include sound effects for win/loss conditions and fail/success conditions
- Could implement a game timer
Won’t:
- Because we never actually spoke with the customer, there are no “won’ts” for this project
- Due to Negative PR, won’t include Alternate skins of Mr Bones to reflect modern political figures; who end users will enjoy hanging
